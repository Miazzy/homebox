This is the home documentation for "Homebox".

If you are planning to self-host your emails, you are in the right place.

This project is for you if:

- You are interested to host your emails yourself, for privacy, security or any other reason.
- You want your server to be secure against both physical and remote intrusion.
- You want a low maintanance box that keep itself updated automatically.
- You trust the Debian community to push security updates.

Finally, this documentation is a work in progress, made in my spare time...
